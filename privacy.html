    <h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
    <p class="effective">Effective Date: February 23, 2026</p>

    <p>Parlay Genie ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard information when you use our mobile application (the "App"). By using Parlay Genie, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <div class="highlight">
      <p><strong>The short version:</strong> Parlay Genie does not require an account, does not sell your data, and does not accept wagers. We are an informational odds comparison tool only.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <p><strong>Information You Provide</strong></p>
    <p>Parlay Genie does not require you to create an account or provide any personal information to use the App. All core features are available immediately without registration.</p>

    <p><strong>Information Collected Automatically</strong></p>
    <p>When you use the App, we may automatically collect limited technical information, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Device type and operating system version</li>
      <li>App version and crash reports</li>
      <li>General usage data (e.g., features accessed, session duration)</li>
      <li>IP address and general location (country or region level only)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Age Verification</strong></p>
    <p>The App stores a local record on your device confirming you have verified you are 18 years of age or older. This information is stored only on your device and is not transmitted to our servers.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information collected to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide and improve the App's features and functionality</li>
      <li>Diagnose technical issues and fix bugs</li>
      <li>Understand how users interact with the App to improve user experience</li>
      <li>Comply with legal obligations</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Parlay Genie uses the following third-party services:</p>
    <p><strong>The Odds API</strong> — We use The Odds API to retrieve real-time sports betting odds. When the App fetches odds data, your request may be logged by The Odds API in accordance with their privacy policy.</p>
    <p><strong>Sportsbook Deep Links</strong> — When you tap a "BET" button, you are redirected to a third-party sportsbook application or website (such as DraftKings, FanDuel, BetMGM, Caesars, or PointsBet). These third parties have their own privacy policies, and we are not responsible for their data practices.</p>
    <p><strong>Affiliate Links</strong> — We may earn a commission if you sign up for a sportsbook through a link in the App. This does not affect the odds or information displayed to you.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties. We may disclose information only in the following circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To comply with applicable laws, regulations, or legal processes</li>
      <li>To protect the rights, property, or safety of Parlay Genie, our users, or others</li>
      <li>In connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain automatically collected usage data only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy, typically no longer than 12 months. Age verification data is stored locally on your device and can be cleared at any time by deleting and reinstalling the App.</p>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Parlay Genie is intended for users 18 years of age or older. We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 18. If we become aware that a user under 18 has provided personal information, we will take steps to delete such information. If you believe a minor has used the App, please contact us at the address below.</p>

    <h2>7. Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect information collected through the App. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The right to access information we hold about you</li>
      <li>The right to request correction or deletion of your information</li>
      <li>The right to opt out of certain data collection practices</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at the address below.</p>

    <h2>9. Responsible Gambling</h2>
    <p>Parlay Genie is an informational odds comparison tool and does not accept wagers. We encourage all users to gamble responsibly and within the laws of their jurisdiction. If you or someone you know has a gambling problem, please call <strong>1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537)</strong> for free, confidential support.</p>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
